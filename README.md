##  Requirements

* Python 3.7+
* Pygame Zero

Install the dependencies using pip:

pip install pgzero
```

##  How to Run

Save the code as `game.py` and run:

```bash
pgzrun game.py
```

Make sure your working directory includes the following image files:

* `dot.png` (green or neutral dot)

These should be in the same folder as your script or inside an `images/` directory as per Pygame Zeroâ€™s asset loading system.

* The game uses `time` for countdowns and mouse click handling for interactions.
* The random dot placement and shuffling ensures a new experience each time.
